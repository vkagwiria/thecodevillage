if statements give us the ability to have our programs decide what lines of code to run, 
depending on the user inputs, calculations, etc
Checks to see if a given condition is True or False
if statements will execute only if the condition is True
# syntax:
if some condition:
    do something
"""
number1 = 5
number2 = 7

# Equality ==
if number2 == number1:
    print("Equal")

# Inequality !=
if number2 != number1:
    print("Not equal")
# Greater than >
if number2 > number1:   
    print("Number is greater")

# Less than <
if number2 < number1:   
    print("Number is less")

# Greater than or equal >=
if number2 >= number1:
    print("Number is greater than or equal to")
# Less or equal <=
if number1 <= number2:
    print("Number is less than or equal to")
# test for even numbers
# user inputs a number
# check whether the number is even
# output to the user "Number is even"
