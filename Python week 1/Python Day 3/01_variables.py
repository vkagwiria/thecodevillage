
# Variables and Variable Naming Rules

# A variable is:
# - the location of storage
# - a container to store some kind of info for use at a later time
# - retrievable by referring to a name that describes said information

#Ex:
first_string_var = "First String"  
first_int_var = 1
total = 1 + 2 * 3

# Variable Naming Rules:
# - It may only contain letters (uppercase or lowercase), numbers or the underscore character _.
# - It may not start with a number.
# - It may not be a keyword (you will learn about them later on).
# - It may not contain spaces

#Ex:
# No spaces are allowed in the variable
# first string value = "First string"

#Ex:
# Cannot start with a number
# 1st_string_value = "First String"

#Ex:
# Cannot be a keyword
# True = "True"
