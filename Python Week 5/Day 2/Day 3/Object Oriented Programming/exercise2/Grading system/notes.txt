Create a folder: Grading System
Create classes (each class or function should be in a separate file):
- School - name, address
- Student - name, stream 
- Subject - name, score
- grading function:

	def grading(score):
	    if score>= 80 and score<=100:
		print("A")
	    elif score>= 60 and score< 80:
		print("B")
	    elif score>= 50 and score< 60:
		print("C")
	    elif score>= 45 and score< 50:
		print("D")
	    elif score>= 25 and score< 45:
		print("E")
	    else:
		print("F")



- main.py: this will contain the logic for getting the school,student and subject details then 
calculate the grades and output the report.

Using the classes:
- Ask for the number of students
- For each student, ask for the school name and address and store in a list
- For each student, ask for their name and stream and store in a list
- For each student, ask for their number of subjects, record the subject name and score
then store in a list
- Grade the subjects then output the report card
